phpLintBash
===========

A quick bash script to recursively lint PHP files in a given directory.
Nice to use as part of a testing stragegy for CI, or after doing an epic merge.

#### Returns:
* Number of Files linted
* Number of Files passed
* Number of Files failed
 * Offending errors
 * Output on STDERR if any files fail linting
* Pass / Fail "Sanity check"
* Proper Exit codes

### Usage
$ phpLint

- Will recursively lint all PHP files in default directory specified in script

$ phpLint [directory]

Lint all files recursively of specified directory

### Overview:
  
* Will return a pass / fail
* Will only pass if all files pass
* Any errors will be output in addition to the file they were found in

### Scope:
* This is a syntax checker. It will not run methods and check for correct returns
* It is not a static analysis tool. Code quality / specs are not enforced or searched for

### Caveats and Best Practice:
* The nature of PHP's lint operation is to abort linting of a file once an error has been found, so...
* ***If a file has multiple errors you will only be notified of the first error***
* Run until you're error-free
* Although linting of the current file may have stopped due to a syntax error, linting of any remaining files in the queue will continue.

### Scripting / Deployment Usage:
* This will return proper exit codes so it can be used for scripting deployments, etc.
* Pass
 * Exit 0 (clean)
 * Output on stdin
* Fail
 * Exit 1
 * Output on stderr

#### Requires: 
* PHP
* /bin/sh
